# Predict-stock-prices
Project to enhance my skills

Project to train my skills

In this project, I built several models to predict the stock prices trend.

I used some ML models like SVM, Linear Regression and Lasso
The standard average and the exponential moving average methods
The LSTM model
Most of them perform welll but I remain realistic, it's also posibble that they tend to be overfitting. We shall see.

Let us not forgot that Stock market prices are highly unpredictable and volatile. This means that there are no consistent patterns in the data that allow you to model stock prices over time near-perfectly.

## Future Development
    
* I would like to try to perform better, this kind of work is very interesting and valuable but also very hard to predict so it's quite a challenging experience.
